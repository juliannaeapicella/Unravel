	<h2>Current Progress</h2>
	<p>Complete!</p>
	<p>I began this project by setting up the screens and graphics, then moved onto programming the ball's physics.</p>
	<p>For the final project, I added a "string" from the ball, a score system, and sound.</p>

	<h2>Requirements Met:</h2>
	<p>Ball is interactive and interesting.</p>
	<p>Local storage is used to keep track of how much yarn has been unraveled in the game in total.</p>
	<p>Game does not throw errors (under standard circumstances).</p>
	<p>Though Circle Blast is used as a base, the game is a different genre, uses instense physics mechanics, and generally does not resemble Circle Blast at all.</p>
	<p>Colors and graphics have a distinct, pleasant tone.</p>
	<p>Sound effects are used for the ball hitting the walls/floor, and music plays in the background.</p>
	<p>The game uses intuitive click-and-drag mechanics.</p>
	<p>There are measures in place to prevent errors.</p>
	<p>Images are made to-scale.</p>
	<p>HTML/CSS validate.</p>
	<p>CSS is external.</p>
	<p>Structural tags are used properly.</p>
	<p>Media has been completely changed from what was used in class.</p>
	<p>Code is commented and broken up logically.</p>
	<p>Code goes beyond what was done in class; implements a physics system and uses custom-designed vector math.</p>
	<p>Overall, I accomplished what I set out to do. However, the physics needed to accurately display string physics were too complicated for this project, and thus were replaced with something simpler.</p>
	<p>Getting the string physics right would be satisfying, but something like different colored yarn might be nice, too.</p>
	<p>I think this project deserves an A.</p>
